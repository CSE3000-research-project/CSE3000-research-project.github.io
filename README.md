## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! So feel free to make a Pull request.

### Poster storage structure

All the groups are grouped in based on the year and quarter of the research project edition.
Within this group, each project has its own folder with the name `Group i`.
Each group folder must have a `group_info.yaml` file containing all the group-related information, e.g., project title, supervisor names, etc.
Each group folder also has a subfolder called students.
Within this student folder, each student has their own folder, which contains three files.
The `student_info.yaml` file contains all the student-related information, e.g., name, thesis title, link to the paper, etc.
This folder also contains a preview named `poster.jpg` and the poster itself named `poster.pdf`.

  --title "Example title" \
  --year 2019 \
  --quarter 4 \
  --groupNumber 42 \
  --supervisors "Joe Doe" "Jane Doe"
```
